    I have prepared software packages to accompany some of my publications in the hope that interested readers may take additional value from my work by playing around with the code, and deriving the simulation results for themselves.
</p>
<p>
    I am by no means an experience programmer in any of the programming languages used, and there may very well be bugs and inconsistencies in the code provided.
    I welcome any feedback regarding improvements to these packages, but cannot promise to respond, or implement any changes, in a timely manner.
    Nevertheless, feel free to contact me with your feedback at <tt>rchandan</tt> (at) <tt>ucsb</tt> (dot) <tt>edu</tt>.
</p>
<p>The packages below are organized by their corresponding publication:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
